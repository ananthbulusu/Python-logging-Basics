Logging is an important part of building an application, especially today when there are multiple fronts involved in making a single solution. As the development complexities increase, effective management is the key to ensure the intended results. 

Using logs while building a solution helps with debugging and sorting out the application issues while keeping a check on its performance throughout the development cycle

Python is having its own module _logging_ which can be used for the logging of various events that occur during the process of application development. 

Once the logging module is imported, readable messages can be created usign the the logger.
